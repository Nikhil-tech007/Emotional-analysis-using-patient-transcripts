# Emotional-analysis-using-patient-transcripts
This project analyzes interview transcripts to understand the emotional changes of participants throughout the conversation and identify key topics discussed. By visualizing this data, we can gain insights into how individuals react to specific questions and uncover hidden patterns in their responses.

## Project Overview
This repository contains:

- Interview Transcripts
- Prompt Engineering scripts
- Emotion Topic Data

## Methodology
Prompt Engineering:

- Carefully design prompts to guide AI models (ChatGPT) in extracting relevant information from the transcripts.
- Focus on prompts that capture emotional cues (e.g., sentiment, tone) and identify key topics discussed.
  
## AI-Powered Analysis:

- Utilize ChatGPT to process the transcripts using the engineered prompts.
Extract data on emotional changes (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and key topics mentioned in each response.


## Visualization:

Created visualizations using Tableau to represent the emotional trajectories of participants and highlight key topics discussed.


## Tools Used
- ChatGPT
- Tableau
